## Icons for Actions
- When replacing text-based buttons (like "Edit" or "Delete") with icon-only buttons, it is critical to include `aria-label` attributes to ensure the buttons remain accessible to screen readers. For example: `<a href="..." aria-label="Edit" title="Edit"><i class="bi bi-pencil"></i></a>`.

## Layout and Spacing
- Adding `align-middle` to Bootstrap tables ensures that text in rows containing thumbnail images aligns properly with the center of the image, significantly improving the visual appearance of the list.
- Adding a subtle shadow (`shadow-sm`) to main content containers helps separate the content from the background, adding depth to the page layout.

**Learning:** Icon-only buttons for managing secondary elements (like attachments) also need accessibility labels, not just the main content lists.
**Action:** Always check secondary panels or list groups when scanning for missing aria-labels on icon buttons.
